#summary The steps required to customise your site.

Once you've played with the code, you'll want to make the site yours.

== First steps - config.php ==

 * Pick a domain name. Buy it!
 * Edit config.php:
  # Set the city name.
  # Set email address.
  # Set wiki location.
  # Sort out paypal stuff.

== Sort out the text on various pages ==

 * Edit other/dbcreate-categories.sql - You need to choose categories. Write introductions. Then run the following command (note that it deletes everything in your existing database!):
{{{
$ cd ~/justliving/
$ mysql -p -u justliving justliving < other/dbcreate-sample.sql
}}}
 
 * Now edit the following files. This is just changing text:there is no computer coding here!
  # httpdocs/stockists/index.php
  # httpdocs/about.php
  # httpdocs/resources/index.php
  # httpdocs/getinvolved.php
  # httpdocs/principles/index.php

== The database ==

 * Now start populating the database...

== Look and feel - the CSS and logos ==

 * You will want to adjust the .css so that the style is what you want.

_The below needs to checked_

JL_Logo.gif is used in the "topbar" div element which appears on every page (I think!).

guide-couple.gif is used on the root page, in the bottom right corner of the listings
box.

admin.gif appears on every page at the bottom (link to the admin section)

== Anything else ==
