#summary How to install the justliving code on Ubuntu

= Introduction =

This guide is for how to set up the justliving code on Ubuntu. This is based on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) but should work on any later version. It starts from a fresh install.

= Details =

First install the required packages:

{{{
$ sudo aptitude install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server mysql-client php5-mysql subversion
}}}

You will be asked to set the root password for mysql. After this command, you should create the justliving database in mysql. 

_This should eventually be replaced by a script._

{{{
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
mysql> create database justliving;
mysql> grant all privileges on justliving.* to 'justliving'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
mysql> quit
}}}

Next download the justliving code. For this example we'll use the home directory - /home/user - and link to it from the web root (/var/www)

{{{
$ cd
$ svn checkout http://justliving.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ justliving
$ cd /var/www/
$ sudo ln -s /home/user/justliving/httpdocs justliving
}}}

Then we need to set up some sample files to be the real files.

{{{
$ cd ~/justliving/
$ cp httpdocs/config.php.sample httpdocs/config.php
$ cp httpdocs/css/website.css.sample httpdocs/css/website.css
$ cp httpdocs/stockists/index.php.sample httpdocs/stockists/index.php
$ cp phpincs/dbconn.php.sample phpincs/dbconn.php
}}}

You should then edit those 3 files as necessary. The most important is phpincs/dbconn.php where you will have to set your database password.

You also need to create the initial database.

{{{
$ cd ~/justliving/
$ mysql -p -u justliving justliving < other/dbcreate.sql
}}}

This (currently) creates all the tables, and puts initial values into the categories and flags tables.

You should then be able to go to your web browser and enter http://localhost/justliving/ and see the site :) (or http://yoursite.com/justliving/ if the web browser is not on the same computer as the web server).
