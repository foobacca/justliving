#summary How to install the justliving code on Ubuntu

= Introduction =

This guide is for how to set up the justliving code on Ubuntu. This is based on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) but should work on any later version. It starts from a fresh install.

= Details =

First install the required packages:

{{{
$ sudo aptitude install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server mysql-client php5-mysql subversion
}}}

You will be asked to set the root password for mysql. After this command, you should create the justliving database in mysql. _This should eventually be replaced by a script._

{{{
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
mysql> create database justliving;
mysql> grant all privileges on justliving.* to 'justliving'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
mysql> quit
}}}
