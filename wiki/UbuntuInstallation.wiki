#summary How to install the justliving code on Ubuntu

= Introduction =

This guide is for how to set up the justliving code on Ubuntu. This is based on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) but should work on any later version. It starts from a fresh install.

= Details =

First install the required packages:

{{{
$ sudo aptitude install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server mysql-client php5-mysql subversion
}}}

You will be asked to set the root password for mysql. After this command, you should create the justliving database in mysql. 

_This should eventually be replaced by a script._

{{{
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
mysql> create database justliving;
mysql> grant all privileges on justliving.* to 'justliving'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
mysql> quit
}}}

Next download the justliving code. For this example we'll use the home directory - /home/user - and link to it from the web root (/var/www)

{{{
$ cd
$ svn checkout http://justliving.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ justliving
$ cd /var/www/
$ sudo ln -s /home/user/justliving/httpdocs justliving
}}}

Then we need to set up some sample files to be the real files.

{{{
$ cd ~/justliving/
$ cp httpdocs/config.php.sample httpdocs/config.php
$ cp httpdocs/css/website.css.sample httpdocs/css/website.css
$ cp httpdocs/stockists/index.php.sample httpdocs/stockists/index.php
$ cp phpincs/dbconn.php.sample phpincs/dbconn.php
}}}

You should then edit those 3 files as necessary. The most important is phpincs/dbconn.php where you will have to set your database password.

You also need to create the initial database. Note there are 3 files in other/

 * dbcreate-base.sql creates the tables in the database but leaves them empty, apart from the flags table which has standard values. It will delete all existing data in the tables.
 * dbcreate-categories.sql creates the tables in the database but leaves them empty, apart from the flags table (as above) and the categories table has the categories from the Cambridge site. It will delete all pre-existing data in the tables.
 * dbcreate-base.sql creates the tables in the database and puts lots of data in so you can play with the website properly. The email addresses and other personal info is made up. It will delete all pre-existing data in the tables.

{{{
$ cd ~/justliving/
$ mysql -p -u justliving justliving < other/dbcreate-sample.sql
}}}

You should then be able to go to your web browser and enter http://localhost/justliving/ and see the site :) (or http://yoursite.com/justliving/ if the web browser is not on the same computer as the web server).

= To Do = 

 * how to set up passwords for the admin section (apache config)
 * setting up the site with multiple domains

Basically just need to find good guides on the web and link to them.
