Just Living - a proper positive guide to Cambridge was set up by a group of 'volunteers' sometime in 2005. The idea was to collect together listings of socially responsible organisations in Cambridge and publish an A5 zine to shout about them.

We had some 'techies' on our side and we soon had an online admin system to help us collect the information on the organisations in a organised way. A website soon followed.

The website and admin system continued to be developed by the group and in 2008 some 'connections' in other cities expressed an interest in getting their own version of Just Living up and running.

So we decided to host our code here to allow other people to use the work we've done so far. And to hopefully continue to develop and spread the idea of publishing information about proper positive stuff and stick two fingers up at capitalism in the process.
